## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Data Preprocessing

Run the script to clean and prepare the dataset:

```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py
```

This script handles tasks like missing value treatment, feature encoding, and scaling.

### 2. Model Training

Train the predictive model using:

```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

The script splits the dataset, trains the regression model(s), and evaluates their performance.

### 3. Visualization & Analysis

Generate visualizations to explore data trends:

```bash
python src/visualize.py
```

This creates insightful plots that help in understanding the data and model predictions.

---

## 📈 Results

After running the training script, you might see performance metrics like:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** *12345.67*
- **R² Score:** *0.85*

Visualizations from the EDA step provide deeper insights into feature relationships and model performance.  
*Feel free to include screenshots or sample charts here to highlight key results.*
